## finding the property

It's easy to find properties for sale but it's another thing to know if it's a good deal. It doesn't help that common sense would say that  one wouldn't sell a profitable, income-producing property. Still, from the properties that are for sale, how do you determine the best deals?

### metrics
* cap rate
* previous rents
* surrounding rents
* comps

### other
* appraisal
* physical defect identification (helps you negotiate or get a better deal)
* other non-financial metrics/pitfalls (why is it for sale despite common sense?)

### software tools at this phase
* redfin, zillow, etc
	- very limited, no good investor metrics
	- great starting point / data source for adding metrics
		- where to get the derived data for metrics?
	- provides rent information
		- get local rent data from city for comparison

## buying the property

Once a good deal has been discovered using the tools and methods noted above, and you decide to buy:

0. managing the buying process
	- placing the offer
	- handling counter-offers
	- negotiation, etc
1. insertion into next phase

### software tools at this phase
NONE

## managing the property

### maintenance
* utilities
* repairs

### renting
* vacancy posting
* online tenant interaction
	- payment tools
	- maintenance requests

### team
* property manager portal
	- give access to a subset of your properties, etc
* accountant portal
* lawyer portal

### software tools at this phase
* appfolio.com

## selling the property

reversing the criteria of the buying phase

### metrics
* cap rate
* equity gained
* other stuff we haven't learned yet (this whole document is shows this ignorance well, but we need a starting point!)

software must indicate when you're likely better off selling a property.


## through every phase

* accounting

There seems to be need for a unified software bringing all these together, and allowing for the automatic accounting thereof.

* cash flow information
	- are your properties positive or negative every month?
	- total and tiered down to the units

* other data points
