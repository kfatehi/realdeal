# What ?

Realdeal is your personal real estate database.

Buying a property, in my opinion, isn't something to be done willy nilly
-- if you need to write some software to make it feel less fucked up, 
I think you should write that software. That's what I'm doing with
realdeal.

Use it to keep track of properties that you find from different sources
(emails from your agent, browsing Redfin, etc); it doesn't matter where
the data comes from, realdeal will take as much or as little data from you
in order to populate fields in the database -- at the minimum, realdeal
requires the street address -- this is used to ping various sources
such as Redfin to pick up the remaining data.

# Why ?

A few reasons:

## Notifications

Redfin has a "Favorite" feature which works well, especially for
getting updates regarding changes to a property, but most of us don't
have the time (or interest, in my case) to pore over emails. 

## Recon

Why should you have to drive to the property? Despite what people tell
you, we are in fact in the age of robotics. Don't move your lazy ass off
that chair, just connect your shit and send your bot -- take video and
snap pictures directly into the property recon data subset.

## Math & Analysis

Check comps and get stats data YOUR way, not how Redfin tells you. We'll
source from Redfin as needed to seed data for use in your more advanced
or custom calculations. Discover the value of your potential properties
YOUR way.

## Real Estate Agents

Dealing with real estate agents has been frustrating for me. I either
feel like I'm wasting their time or that they're wasting mine -- there
is just general discomfort due to the synchronous nature of the
relationship. What I mean by that is other than their drip-emailer
(which I abhor and don't look at anyway), they have no collaborative
toolset that doesn't involve phone calls or face to face, hence the
feeling of time-wasting.

Instead, realdeal, through the Action system will seek to make the
relationship between the buyer and his agent smooth and asynchronous.

## Action

When a good deal or property is discovered, and you want to take action
on it, what the hell are you supposed to do? I think a "Buy" button is
in order. Clicking this button should begin or continue what's
essentially a Wizard through the home-buying process. e.g. check pre-approval, 
check budget, did you go look at the home in person? yes? you liked it?
did you identify and problems yet? No? Here's what you should check for,
print it and come back and fill that data in. Algorithm should help you
figure out an offer. Anyway things get fuckin complicated here and I
don't know how people do this without software.

Ideally, the Action system should be so great by the time I'm through
with it that it can be used to multiplex your homebuying efforts across
many more properties than you'd normally be able to handle.

## Rental Management

What if you buy an income property? What are your responsibilities? What
other bullshit do you have to deal with?

Do I really want to enter the tenant's number into my phone? I should
just put the tentant's info into Realdeal under that Property, under
that Unit where his information belongs.

Realdeal should help you with this sort of thing -- this won't be 
implemented unless I'm really buying or do end up buying an income property.

## Financial Matters

Since realdeal is not just for the property acquisition process, but
also for post-acquisition, things like mortgage, utilities, and
other financial data like this regarding the property should stick with
the property.

## Collaboration & Sharing

Buying a property is not a solo project -- we want to consult with a lot
of different people every step of the way. Realdeal facilitates this via
invite links that bring others into the platform.

# I thought you stopped working on this?

I thought I did, but shit man, I really need it ... and it looks like
it will need to get built before I can feel comfortable buying any property.
